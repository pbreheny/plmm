\arguments{
\item{X}{Design matrix. May include clinical covariates and other non-SNP data. If this is the case, X_for_K should be supplied witha  matrix containing only SNP data for computation of GRM.}

\item{y}{Continuous outcome vector.}

\item{X_for_K}{X matrix used to compute the similarity matrix, K. For multi-chromosome analysis this may be supplied in order to perform a leave-one-chromosome-out correction. The objective here is to adjust for population stratification and unobserved confounding without rotating out the causal SNP effects.}

\item{penalty}{The penalty to be applied to the model. Either "MCP" (the default), "SCAD", or "lasso".}

\item{gamma}{The tuning parameter of the MCP/SCAD penalty (see details). Default is 3 for MCP and 3.7 for SCAD.}

\item{alpha}{Tuning parameter for the Mnet estimator which controls the relative contributions from the MCP/SCAD penalty and the ridge, or L2 penalty. alpha=1 is equivalent to MCP/SCAD penalty, while alpha=0 would be equivalent to ridge regression. However, alpha=0 is not supported; alpha may be arbitrarily small, but not exactly 0.}

\item{lambda.min}{The smallest value for lambda, as a fraction of lambda.max. Default is .001 if the number of observations is larger than the number of covariates and .05 otherwise.}

\item{nlambda}{The smallest value for lambda, as a fraction of lambda.max. Default is .001 if the number of observations is larger than the number of covariates and .05 otherwise.}

\item{lambda}{A user-specified sequence of lambda values. By default, a sequence of values of length nlambda is computed, equally spaced on the log scale.}

\item{eps}{Convergence threshold. The algorithm iterates until the RMSD for the change in linear predictors for each coefficient is less than eps. Default is \code{1e-4}.}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations (total across entire path). Default is 10000.}

\item{convex}{Calculate index for which objective function ceases to be locally convex? Default is TRUE.}

\item{dfmax}{Upper bound for the number of nonzero coefficients. Default is no upper bound. However, for large data sets, computational burden may be heavy for models with a large number of nonzero coefficients.}

\item{warn}{Return warning messages for failures to converge and model saturation? Default is TRUE.}

\item{penalty.factor}{A multiplicative factor for the penalty applied to each coefficient. If supplied, penalty.factor must be a numeric vector of length equal to the number of columns of X. The purpose of penalty.factor is to apply differential penalization if some coefficients are thought to be more likely than others to be in the model. In particular, penalty.factor can be 0, in which case the coefficient is always in the model without shrinkage.}

\item{init}{Initial values for coefficients.}

\item{returnX}{Return the standardized design matrix along with the fit? By default, this option is turned on if X is under 100 MB, but turned off for larger matrices to preserve memory.}

\item{intercept}{Logical flag for whether an intercept should be included.}

\item{centerRtY}{Logical flag for whether the rotated outcome variable, SUy, should be centered and an intercept coefficient estimated based on its mean. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{standardizeX}{Logical flag for X matrix standardization, prior to data transformation. The coefficients are always returned on the original scale. Default is TRUE. If variables are in the same units already, or manually standardized, you might not wish to standardize.}

\item{standardizeRtX}{Logical flag for transformed X matrix scaling (or rescaling). The coefficients are always returned on the original scale. Default is TRUE. If variables are in the same units already, or manually standardized, you might not wish to standardize, but this is generally recommended.}

\item{rotation}{Logical flag to indicate whether the weighted rotation of the data should be performed (TRUE), or not (FALSE). This is primarily for testing purposes and defaults to TRUE.}

\item{eta_centerY}{Logical flag to indicate whether eta should be estimated using a centerd outcome variable, y. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{eta_star}{Optional arg to input a specific eta term rather than estimate it from the data.}

\item{V}{Optional arg to input a specified covariance structure for y, used to rotate the data, into the model.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
