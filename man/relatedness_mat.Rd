\title{Calculate a relatedness matrix}
\usage{
relatedness_mat(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of genotypes (from \emph{fully-imputed} data)}
}
\description{
This function allows you to generate an n by n genetic relatedness matrix. If a numeric matrix is supplied, the RRM (Hayes, 2009) is used
and is computed XX'/p, where X is standardized.
}
\examples{
RRM <- relatedness_mat(X = admix$X)
