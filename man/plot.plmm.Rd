\usage{
\method{plot}{plmm}(x, alpha = 1, log.l = FALSE, shade = TRUE, col, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class plmm}

\item{alpha}{Tuning parameter for the Mnet estimator which controls the relative contributions from the MCP/SCAD penalty and the ridge, or L2 penalty. \code{alpha=1} is equivalent to MCP/SCAD penalty, while \code{alpha=0} would be equivalent to ridge regression. However, \code{alpha=0} is not supported; alpha may be arbitrarily small, but not exactly 0.}

\item{log.l}{Logical to indicate the plot should be returned on the natural log scale. Defaults to \code{log.l = FALSE}.}

\item{shade}{Logical to indicate whether a local nonconvex region should be shaded. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{col}{Color vector.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}
