Description: Fits penalized linear mixed models that correct for unobserved 
    confounding factors. 'plmmr' infers and corrects for the presence of unobserved 
    confounding effects such as population stratification and environmental 
    heterogeneity. It then fits a linear model via penalized maximum 
    likelihood. Originally designed for the multivariate analysis of SNP data, 
    'plmmr' eliminates the need for subpopulation-specific analyses and 
    post-analysis p-value adjustments. Functions for the appropriate processing 
    of 'PLINK' files are also supplied. For examples, see the package homepage
